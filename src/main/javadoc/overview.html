The DSpace Services Framework provides the infrastructure of a more
componentized realization of DSpace.  Services, plugins, and providers
are registered with the framework so that they can find each other without
having to know each other too intimately.  This should make it easier to
maintain, extend, and understand DSpace as it evolves.
</p>

<p>The framework consists of:</p>

<dl>
 <dt>kernel</dt>
 <dd>initializes and starts the framework,
     grants ready access to core services</dd>
 <dt>service manager</dt>
 <dd>instantiates, configures, and controls services</dd>
 <dt>core services</dt>
 <dd>configuration, events, and the like</dd>
 <dt>utilities</dt>
 <dd>includes the DSpace object, a starting point in using the framework</dd>
</dl>

<p>
To use the Services Framework, start by obtaining a reference to a 
running kernel.
</p>
<ul>
 <li>In a standalone application, you can instantiate {@link 
org.dspace.utils.DSpace the DSpace object}.  It will provide references 
to the kernel and core services.</li>
 <li>In a Spring context you can wire ??? as needed.</li>
 <li>In a servlet context, you should configure a {@link 
org.dspace.servicemanager.servlet.DSpaceKernelServletContextListener 
context listener} and a {@link 
org.dspace.utils.servlet.DSpaceWebappServletFilter filter} to start the 
kernel and establish the connection between the web application and the 
framework.</li>
</ul>

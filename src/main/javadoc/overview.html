The DSpace Services Framework provides the infrastructure of a more
componentized realization of DSpace.  Services, plugins, and providers
are registered with the framework so that they can find each other without
having to know each other too intimately.  This should make it easier to
maintain, extend, and understand DSpace as it evolves.

<p>The framework consists of:</p>

<dl>
 <dt>kernel</dt>
 <dd>initializes and starts the framework,
     grants ready access to core services</dd>
 <dt>service manager</dt>
 <dd>instantiates, configures, and controls services</dd>
 <dt>core services</dt>
 <dd>configuration, events, and the like</dd>
 <dt>utilities</dt>
 <dd>includes the DSpace object, a starting point in using the framework</dd>
</dl>
